# Website "MCL"


This is a website for my girl friend.I am a novice in web development.  I am learning all the relevant knowledge now. This is a social style webpage I am writing, just html pages with some js.

This website is based on Bootstrap and I also refer to the theme from Bootstrap. You can visit this site through: http://clarkyu2016.github.io/mcl
